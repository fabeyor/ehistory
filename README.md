Enhanced Linux History

Linux history is a good source of information, but in scenarios where you need to attribute commands executed to the responsible user with the timestamp and remote source address â€” the default history entries lack the contextual information you need.

Follow this simple instruction to enhance your history entries:

     - copy the "ehistory.sh" script to /etc/profile.d/
     - sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/ehistory.sh
     - Load the updated source file to implement the enhancements OR Logout and Login OR reboot the system: 
               sudo source /etc/profile.d/ehistory.sh
     

The above-added entry will display the remote source network address, responsible user, timestamp and the command executed per entry. Sample output would look something like the image below:

Known Issues: 
-------------

-    When clone or copy the content of the script, you might find it does now give the desired result. This is usually due to how quotation marks or some special characters are transcribed when ported from one system to another.

Fix:
----
-    Rewrite all the Quotaion Marks and apostrophes(i.e " ", ' ', '). and reload the script.
