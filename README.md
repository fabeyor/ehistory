Enhanced Linux History

Linux history is a good source of information, but in scenarios where you need to attribute commands executed to the responsible user with the timestamp and remote source address â€” the default history entries lack the contextual information you need.

Follow this simple instruction to enhance your history entries:

     - copy the "ehistory.sh" script to /etc/profile.d/
     - sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/ehistory.sh
     - Load the updated source file to implement the enhancements OR Logout and Login OR reboot the system: 
               sudo source /etc/profile.d/ehistory.sh
     

The above-added entry will display the remote source network address, responsible user, timestamp and the command executed per entry. Sample output would look something like the image below:

Known Issues:

Fix:
----
-    Rewrite all the Quotaion Marks and apostrophes(i.e " ", ' ', '). and reload the script.
